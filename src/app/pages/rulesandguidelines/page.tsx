            <strong>Prohibited Content:</strong> Users shall not utilize HeliosMarket services to post any content that is illegal, fraudulent, deceptive, or harmful. This includes the unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or sharing of items that do not belong to them, unless proper rights have been obtained.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cryptocurrency Sales:</strong> HeliosMarket strictly prohibits the sale of any form of cryptocurrency, including but not limited to Bitcoin, ICOs, non-icons, coins, tokens, and all digital products of a similar nature. Any attempt to list or sell cryptocurrency will result in the automatic blocking of the post, and the user&apos;s account will be unapproved. Until HeliosMarket can secure chargeback protection through Stripe, which usually takes 6 months, we will not permit users to sell crypto. Please be advised that we do plan to integrate a HIVE Blockchain payment method with HBD and HELIOS soon. Once we add a crypto payment layer we will be open to letting users trade crypto in a P2P manner.
